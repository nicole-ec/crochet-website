                        Hey guys! We're back from hiatus with a brand new website to help set our place on the internet.
                        Nothing much has actually changed, our dev team (person) is still in school <span class="strikethrough">suffering</span>, and the rest of us are working.
                        We hope that this practice site would give our dev team (person) some experience at creating a live site in the future. Until then, please stay tuned to our

                        Our crochet team has decided on a new line of merch for you to enjoy! The next few months will be spent making them, but should be ready during the holiday season.

                        Hey guys! We hope you're all staying safe during this uncertain time.
                        We had some merch ready to sell at the upcoming Otafest convention, but due to current circumstances we won't be able to sell any of our items at a physical location.
                        We are looking into online methods at this time, but nothing is ready quite yet.
                        We will keep you posted on our <a href="https://www.instagram.com/1ordinary.arts/">Instagram page</a> for the mean time.
                        Thank you for your patience, let's stay strong together! &#128170;
