                    Hey guys! We're back from hiatus with a brand new website to help set our place on the internet.
                    Nothing much has actually changed, our dev team (person) is still in school <span class="strikethrough">suffering</span>, and the rest of us are working.
                    We hope that this practice site would give our dev team (person) some practice at creating a live site in the future. Until then, please stay tuned to our
                    Instagram page for updates!

                <div class="article-detail">
                    Hey guys! We hope you're all staying safe during this uncertain time.
                    We had some merch ready to sell at the upcoming Otafest convention, but due to current circumstances we won't be able to sell any of our items at a physical location.
                    We are looking into online methods at this time, but nothing is ready quite yet.
                    We will keep you posted on our Instagram page @1ordinary.arts for the mean time.
                    Thank you for your patience, let's stay strong together! &#128170;
